# protoserial library

Library intended for rapid prototyping of embedded devices with support of standard interfaces such as USB, UART and RS485. It supports addressing for interfaces where it makes sense and tries to be as modular and easily extensible as possible.

**Right now the library is in a pre-pre-alpha stage with no guarantee of API or architectural stability.**
