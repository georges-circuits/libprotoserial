Install mkdocs if you haven't already, [here](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/#installation) are the instructions. For full documentation visit [mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org).

# View Docs locally

Run `mkdocs serve` from the root project directory, this starts up a local server to which you can connect using your browser, usually at [`http://127.0.0.1:8000/`](http://127.0.0.1:8000/). The server watches for changes and automatically refreshes the site.

There is no need to use the `mkdocs build`, this creates all the html files needed for deployment and we use a different method for that.
