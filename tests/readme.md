This is a playground folder of sorts, excluding the tests.cpp file, which houses the unit-tests of individual modules of this library. Other files may be outdated, they are used for initial testing of new implementations and generally things that do not belong into the unit-test file. Since these other files are usually quite simple, they are excluded from the cmake configuration as well, you can build them using `make [name of the file without the extension]`
